# Seed notes — TODO: name your database

Notes from the data owner: the business documentation that profiling cannot
derive. If a generated metric contradicts a rule here, the metric is wrong,
not the rule.

## What this database is

TODO: one paragraph — domain, time span, rough size.

## Rules you must follow (the gotchas)

1. **Cancelled orders are not revenue.** Example rule, in the owner's voice:
   rows with `status IN ('CANCELLED', 'RETURNED')` are excluded from every
   revenue and margin number. Replace it with YOUR rules — the "why these
   numbers are right" facts no schema scan reveals (status semantics,
   currency cutovers, which table is the fact table, join-key traps).

## Metric definitions

TODO: the metrics you want governed, in plain words, each citing the rule(s)
above that make them right.
